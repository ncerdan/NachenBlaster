My first intensive, object-oriented-based game. 

Personally responsible for the following files: 
    Actor.h 
    Actor.cpp
    StudentWorld.h
    StudentWorld.cpp
These four files contained all of the game object logic including
movement, enemy action, collissions, and everything imbetween!

How long can you survive?
